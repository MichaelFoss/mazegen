;
; Treasure data file.
;
; Stores all of the possible treasure that can be found in a maze.
;
; Each line requires the following comma-delimited format:
;
; <treasureName>,<points>,<expiration>,<frequency>
;
; Where <treasureName> is any non-HTML string (the images for the
; treasure will be retrieved from
; www/img/treasure/icon/<treasureName>.png and
; www/img/treasure/detail/<treasureName>.png,
; with all non-alphanumeric characters being converted to dashes
; and all text changing to lowercase), <points> are the amount
; of points to assign to the player for picking it up, <expiration>
; is an integer giving the number of steps a treasure will disappear
; in (0 for forever), and <frequency> is the frequency of the treasure
; appearing relative to all other treasures (so for treasures A, B,
; and C with freq. 1, 2, and 2, A has a 20% chance and B & C have
; a 40% chance).
;
; Empty lines, lines prefixed with semicolons or hash marks, and
; invalid data lines are ignored.
